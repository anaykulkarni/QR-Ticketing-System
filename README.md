# QR-Ticketing-System

Ticket verification is a specialized task. In our day to day life, we have witnessed several situations wherein inadequacy in ticket validation systems, has more often than not, resulted in generation of fraudulent tickets. This leads to huge monitory losses to the respective proprietors. With the advances in technology today, several systems have come up which allow us to implement a nearly incorruptible security system to validate the authenticity of the tickets. In this document, we attempt to explore the application of one such technology- QR code (Quick Response Code). A QR code is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application. A QR code uses four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to store data efficiently; extensions may also be used.

The ticket verification system under discussion, is a proposed solution, to be implemented as a real time ticket validation system for the annual food festival, ’Annotsav’, organized by The Rotary Club of Belgaum. The system comprises of a sub system for large scale generation of unique QR codes; one for storing the QR codes in a local database and one for scanning and verifying the QR codes for their authenticity.
